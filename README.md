The Matterport system typically involves a camera (such as the Matterport Pro2 or Pro2 Lite) that captures 360-degree panoramic images of a space and then uses software to stitch these images together into a cohesive 3D model. Users can navigate through these models online or in virtual reality, providing a realistic and interactive experience of the physical space without actually being there.
